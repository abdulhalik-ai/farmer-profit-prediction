# Farmer Profit / Loss Prediction using Machine Learning

## About the Project
Farmers often face uncertainty due to changing climate conditions,
rainfall variations, and fertilizer usage.  
This project predicts whether a farmer will experience **Profit** or
**Loss** based on basic agricultural inputs using Machine Learning.

This is a beginner-friendly project created for learning and
academic purposes.

---

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Analyze agricultural input data
- Predict farmer profit or loss
- Understand how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab  

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains basic farming-related inputs and an output label.

| Column Name  | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| temperature | Average temperature (°C) |
| rainfall    | Rainfall amount (mm) |
| fertilizer  | Fertilizer used (kg) |
| profit      | 1 = Profit, 0 = Loss |

The dataset is used only for educational and learning purposes.

## Machine Learning Approach
- Type: Supervised Learning  
- Category: Classification  
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression  

---

## How the Project Works
1. Load the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Train the Logistic Regression model
4. Test the model accuracy
5. Predict profit or loss for new inputs

---

## Output
The model predicts whether the given farming conditions will result
in **Profit** or **Loss**.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple and practical use of machine learning
in agriculture. It helps beginners understand classification models
and real-life data applications.

---

## Future Scope
